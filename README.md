# video-player

For this project, I made three React components work together to create a responsive video player.

## Essentially this project demonstrates the design pattern whose description is as follows:
1. keeping state in a parent component and passing props down to child components(`<App />` component)
2. using a child component to display the state (`<Video />` component)
3. using a different child component to change the state (`<Menu />` component)
